# intro
Hello everyone! In my fourth semester of ict in Fontys Eindhove I chose the Specialization AI.
For the group project, I worked with a team of previous software students [arthur](https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers), [Cédric](https://github.com/basjebasie), [Rik](https://github.com/RFieret), [Michal](https://github.com/MichalI495002)

For the individual project, I had the opportunity to work with a student and choose a topic and scope of the project. This allowed us to explore our shared interests. Together, we worked to design, develop, test the software and much more.

further down in this document u can find links to what i have been working on in semester 3. In the individuel project i worked together with Arthur Brouwers, and in the group project i worked together with Arthur Brouwers, Rik Fieret, Casper van den Dijk, Cedric Berden.
